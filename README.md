# Space Rocks
Move as a ship with left and right arrow keys and propel yourself with the down arrow.
Shoot with either shift key and avoid getting hit by the rocks

Game made from some simple scripts and a few sprite objects on a screen.

Learned:

- Object collision
- Game over flagging
- Room resets
